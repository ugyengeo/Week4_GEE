# NDVI Analysis and Visualization in Google Earth Engine

This project calculates and visualizes the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** for selected regions in Greater Melbourne using Google Earth Engine (GEE).  
NDVI highlights healthy vegetation, differentiates water bodies, bare soil, and built-up areas, providing insights into vegetation health and land cover patterns.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to assess vegetation health across Greater Melbourne by processing satellite imagery to generate NDVI maps.  
These maps can be used for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and identifying areas of low vegetation or stressed vegetation.
